# Developing Okdata CLI

## Setup

Requirement: Python 3.8+

Setup:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:oslokommune/okdata-cli.git
cd okdata-cli
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make init
```

## Environment

Okdata CLI can be run in either `dev` or `prod`.

When determining in which environment to run a command, the application loads
the environment in the following order, and chooses the first it encounters:

1. `--env=prod|dev` option for every command
2. `OKDATA_ENVIRONMENT` from the current environment
3. Default: `prod`

## Tests

Automatic tests are run with the following command:

```sh
make test
```

## Documentation

Documentation is written in Markdown and is located in the `doc` directory.

## Making a new release

Make sure that `CHANGELOG.md` is up to date and committed to `main`, then run:

```sh
make bump-version-{patch,minor,major}
```

Use the `-patch`, `-minor`, or `-major` variant of the command according to
whether the new release is a patch, minor, or major version respectively.

### Uploading to PyPI

Okdata CLI releases are hosted at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/okdata-cli/),
making it easy to install using `pip install okdata-cli`.

Run the following command to build the new version:

```sh
make build
```

Then upload it PyPI by running the following command:

```sh
make publish
```

### Making a GitHub release

Making a GitHub release will automatically notify subscribers of the repository
and members of our support channel on Slack about the new release.

The `bump-version` command from before should have created a new Git tag. Push
it to GitHub:

```sh
git push origin tag <version-tag-name>
```

Run `git tag -l` if you're unsure about the tag name.

After pushing the tag, navigate to
`https://github.com/oslokommune/okdata-cli/tags` and find the newly pushed tag
in the top of the list. Select the three dots (â€¦), and then "Create release".

Use the same format for the title and description as previous releases. The
bullet points are copied from the changelog file.
